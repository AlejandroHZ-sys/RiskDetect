# 🛡️ RiskDetect – Intelligent Financial Risk Detection

RiskDetect is a web-based application that uses Machine Learning to detect potentially risky or anomalous financial transactions from uploaded datasets. This project was developed by three Computer Systems Engineering students as part of a portfolio piece to showcase our skills in:

- Machine Learning
- Web development (frontend + backend)
- Basic cybersecurity practices
- Database design and integration
- Software architecture and collaboration using Git

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Apply anomaly detection techniques to real or synthetic financial data.
- Implement secure user authentication (hashing passwords, JWT).
- Provide a user-friendly interface for uploading data and viewing risk predictions.
- Visualize risk scores through tables and interactive graphs.
- Practice full-stack development and teamwork using GitHub.
